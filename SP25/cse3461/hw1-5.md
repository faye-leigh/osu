## P5

Suppose N packets arrive simultaneously to a link at which no packets are currently
being transmitted or queued. Each packet is of length L and the link has transmission rate R. What is
the average queuing delay for the N packets?

#### Answer:

When N packets arrive simultaneously, the first packet experiences no queuing delay, the second packet experiences a delay equal to the transmission time of the first packet, the third packet experiences a delay equal to the transmission time of the first two packets, and so on.

The transmission time for one packet is L/R

The total queuing delay for all N packets is: 0 + L/R + 2(L/R) + ... + (N-1)(L/R)

This is an arithmetic series with the sum:
L/R \* (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (N-1)) = L/R \* (N-1) \* N / 2

The average queuing delay is the total delay divided by the number of packets:
(L/R \* (N-1) \* N / 2) / N = L/R \* (N-1) / 2

So, the average queuing delay for the N packets is:
L \* (N-1) / (2\*R)
